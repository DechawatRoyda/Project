#FISH CARE
<p> I have a lot of experience with using the Arduino IDE. I used to get this job by working on Arduino. The topic is the aquarium system. There is an on-off control of the device. Take time to set up and check using sensors. There is a check for overflow and suction below the water pump. I work with 2 friends. I work on the hardware part of the control box. and connect to the database named firebase and my friend made an application connect to the same database to control on/off and set the control time .This is a hardware and software example. </p>
